#### Summary of the SRX Packet Flow 
Step 1: The packet arrives at the SRX firewall. The firewall reads the packet header to determine the source and destination IP addresses, the protocol, and the ports. This information is used to determine how to process the packet.
Step 2: The firewall looks up the flow in the state table. The state table is a database that stores information about all of the active flows on the SRX firewall. If the flow is found, the firewall uses the information in the state table to process the packet. The information in the state table includes the source and destination IP addresses, the protocol, the ports, and the security policy that is associated with the flow.
Step 3: If the flow is not found, the firewall creates a new flow entry in the state table and then processes the packet. The firewall creates a new flow entry by adding the source and destination IP addresses, the protocol, the ports, and the security policy that is associated with the packet to the state table.
Step 4: The firewall checks the security policies to determine if the packet is allowed or denied. The security policies are a set of rules that define what traffic is allowed to pass through the SRX firewall. If the packet matches a security policy, the packet is allowed to pass through the firewall. If the packet does not match a security policy, the packet is denied.
Step 5: If the packet is allowed, the firewall forwards the packet to the destination. The firewall forwards the packet to the destination by sending the packet out the interface that is connected to the destination network.
Step 6: If the packet is denied, the firewall drops the packet. The firewall drops the packet by discarding the packet and not sending it to the destination.

#### Flow Mode
In flow mode, SRX processes all traffic by analyzing the state or session of traffic. This is also called stateful processing of traffic. 
When a packet arrives at the SRX, the firewall first looks up the flow in the state table. If the flow is found, the firewall uses the information in the state table to process the packet. If the flow is not found, the firewall creates a new flow entry in the state table and then processes the packet.

#### Packet Mode
In packet mode, SRX processes the traffic on a per-packet basis. This is also known as stateless processing of traffic
When a packet arrives at the SRX, the firewall does not maintain a state table for each flow. Instead, the firewall processes each packet individually. This means that the firewall has to examine each packet to determine how to process it.

## Best Practice
The best practice design when implementing an SRX firewall in flow mode and in packet mode depends on the specific requirements of your network. However, there are some general guidelines that you can follow:

- Use flow mode for high-volume traffic. Flow mode is more efficient than packet mode for high-volume traffic. This is because the firewall can cache state table entries for flows that are frequently used. This can help to improve performance and reduce latency.

- Use packet mode for traffic that does not match any security policies. Packet mode is used for traffic that does not match any of the security policies. This type of traffic is typically known as "unscanned traffic." Packet mode is less efficient than flow mode, but it is still necessary to process this type of traffic.

- Use a combination of flow mode and packet mode. You can use a combination of flow mode and packet mode to optimize the performance of your network. For example, you could use flow mode for high-volume traffic that matches security policies, and then use packet mode for traffic that does not match any security policies.
