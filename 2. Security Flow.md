#### Flow Mode
In flow mode, SRX processes all traffic by analyzing the state or session of traffic. This is also called stateful processing of traffic. 
When a packet arrives at the SRX, the firewall first looks up the flow in the state table. If the flow is found, the firewall uses the information in the state table to process the packet. If the flow is not found, the firewall creates a new flow entry in the state table and then processes the packet.

#### Packet Mode
In packet mode, SRX processes the traffic on a per-packet basis. This is also known as stateless processing of traffic
When a packet arrives at the SRX, the firewall does not maintain a state table for each flow. Instead, the firewall processes each packet individually. This means that the firewall has to examine each packet to determine how to process it.
