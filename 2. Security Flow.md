#### Flow Mode
In flow mode, SRX processes all traffic by analyzing the state or session of traffic. This is also called stateful processing of traffic. 
When a packet arrives at the SRX, the firewall first looks up the flow in the state table. If the flow is found, the firewall uses the information in the state table to process the packet. If the flow is not found, the firewall creates a new flow entry in the state table and then processes the packet.

#### Packet Mode
In packet mode, SRX processes the traffic on a per-packet basis. This is also known as stateless processing of traffic
When a packet arrives at the SRX, the firewall does not maintain a state table for each flow. Instead, the firewall processes each packet individually. This means that the firewall has to examine each packet to determine how to process it.

## Best Practice
The best practice design when implementing an SRX firewall in flow mode and in packet mode depends on the specific requirements of your network. However, there are some general guidelines that you can follow:

- Use flow mode for high-volume traffic. Flow mode is more efficient than packet mode for high-volume traffic. This is because the firewall can cache state table entries for flows that are frequently used. This can help to improve performance and reduce latency.

- Use packet mode for traffic that does not match any security policies. Packet mode is used for traffic that does not match any of the security policies. This type of traffic is typically known as "unscanned traffic." Packet mode is less efficient than flow mode, but it is still necessary to process this type of traffic.

- Use a combination of flow mode and packet mode. You can use a combination of flow mode and packet mode to optimize the performance of your network. For example, you could use flow mode for high-volume traffic that matches security policies, and then use packet mode for traffic that does not match any security policies.
